## Description
"42 So Long" is a 2D game project developed as part of the curriculum at 42 school. The primary goal of this project is to provide students with hands-on experience working with computer graphics, including textures, sprites, window management, event handling, colors, and more. By using the MiniLibX library provided by the school, students can create a basic game while sharpening their programming skills.

## Features
- Basic window management to display the game environment.
- Sprite rendering to bring characters and objects to life.
- Event handling for keyboard and mouse interactions.
- Texture mapping to provide visual details and realism.
- Opportunity to apply fundamental algorithms and improve programming abilities.
- Encourages rigor, research, and problem-solving, in line with the curriculum's goals.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A working C compiler (e.g., gcc) to build the project.
- The MiniLibX library provided by the school.

### Installation
1. Clone the project repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bahbibe/42_so_long.git
   cd 42_so_long
2. Build the project:
    ```sh
   make
3. Run the game
   ```sh
   ./so_long maps/map.ber
## Usage
Upon running the game, you will be presented with the 2D game environment. Interact with the game using the keyboard and mouse to experience the basic gameplay elements you've implemented.

## Libraries Used
This project relies on the MiniLibX library provided by the school. MiniLibX offers essential tools for opening windows, creating images, and handling events.

## Contributing
